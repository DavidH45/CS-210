### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is a Grocery Tracking Program where it takes input from a file and then presents the user with three different options to display the data. The user can search for a particular grocery item, show all grocery items and their amounts, or show all grocery items in a histogram.

### What did you do particularly well?
I wrote well-documented and formatted code while creating this project, making it easy to go back and understand what is in the code.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
After submitting the project, I found that certain user inputs could cause the program to crash; in the future, I will ensure user inputs are passed through more check and always returns either an error or the correct response and never crashes.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of code I had the hardest time getting to work on would be the histogram display system and ensuring it displays the correct amount. After struggling for a while, I used my resources to find a solution to the problem.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project shows skills in writing clean and well-documented code in C++. I can use this skill in creating other C++ projects in the future. 

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by ensuring the code was well documented and well written in a way that anyone could pick it up and easily pick up where I left off if needed.
